AStar
=====

A repository for the AStar excercise (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)

Participants:
- Lars Liverød Andersen 
- Truls Mørk Pettersen 

task1/astar.py will find the shortest path from A-B on the first 4 boards, by using the A* algorithm.
Run it, choose map from 1-4, and the map will be printed.

task2/astar2.py will find the shortest path from A-B on all of the 8 boards. Here the user can choose between 
3 algorithms and 8 boards. On the board 5-8, the algorithms will consider weight of different terrain costs aswell!
